# apiel
Apiel is a small subset of the [APL programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) implemented in Rust. 

The ultimate goal of the project is to export a macro that allows evaluating APL expressions from Rust code, providing a way to solve some problems in a very conscise manner.

## Affiliation

This is my capstone project for the [rustcamp](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rustcamp), a Rust bootcamp organized by the Ukrainian Rust Community ([website](https://www.uarust.com), [linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ukrainian-rust-community), [telegram](https://t.me/rustlang_ua), [github](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkAFUu2MVOX8ly0LjB6TMA), [twitter](https://twitter.com/rustukraine)).

## Array languages

APL was the first language in an "Array programming" or "Iversonian" paradigm. These languages are closer to mathematical notation than to C-like programming languages. The concepts proposed by APL inspired many similar languages, influenced the development of the functional programming paradigm, and had a giant impact on programming as a whole.
